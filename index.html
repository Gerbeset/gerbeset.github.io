    <h2>Biography:</h2>
    <p>I was born in Wyoming and was raised across the border in Sturgis South Dakota. In high school, I was active in
        music, theather, speech and debate, and Boy Scouts. After high school, I took a gap year and worked in the
        Senate as an intern in Washington D.C. I worked for Senators John Thune (SD) and Steve Daines (MT). I then
        attended the University of South Dakota (Go Yotes!) where I double majored in mathematics and philosophy. Now I
        am a Ph.D. student in mathematics at Texas&nbsp;A&amp;M&nbsp;University under the supervision of Dr. Jean-Luc
        Guermond. My life's passion is solving problems with logic and reason, and I think mathematics is one of best
        ways of doing so.</p>
