        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            I was born in Wyoming and raised in Sturgis, South Dakota. In high school, I was active in music,
            theater, speech and debate, and Boy Scouts. After high school, I took a gap year and worked as an intern
            in the U.S. Senate for Senators John Thune (SD) and Steve Daines (MT).
            I then attended the University of South Dakota, double-majoring in Mathematics and Philosophy.
            Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Mathematics at Texas A&M University under Dr. Jean-Luc Guermond.
            My passion is solving problems with logic and reason, and I consider mathematics one of the best ways to
            do so.
