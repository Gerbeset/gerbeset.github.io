    <h2> Personal Statement </h2>
    <p>
        My passion is solving problems with mathematics. Since the time of Newton, mathematics
        has proven to be the most powerful method of framing, thinking, and then unraveling, the difficult 
        problems we face. The future I envision is one where mathematics does to other fields what it did with physics. 
        Thus, my interests lie in all mathematics, in all fields, and in all forms.
