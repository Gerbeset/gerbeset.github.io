    <h2><em>Foundryside</em> by Robert Jackson Bennett</h2>
    <h3>Category: Fantasy</h3>
    <h3>Rating: 8.5/10</h3>
    <par>This book surprised me. Calling it "magic" is a bit of a misnomer. A better description
        would be magic-based sci-fi. The premise is following: objects can be altered by writing on them (called
        <em>scriving</em>)
        which changes their reality. For example: someone could take a lumber beam, scrive it with sigils that tell it
        it's made of iron, and
        then the beam now behaves as if it was made of iron.

        While the foundation of the story is a kind of magic, its functionality is sci-fi. These sigils can be
        <em>hacked</em>: certain characters
        can "talk" to scrived objects, listen to the logic of their sigils, then twist the meaning to make the scrived
        objects do something they weren't meant to.
        As a programmer, this plot device was immensely interesting. People who know how to write these sigils are
        called <em>scrivers</em>, and they essentially are like
        computer programmers: they think about how to combine different sigils and "words" to have a desired effects.
        They have massive objects called <em>lexicons</em> to
        define new sigils, but it only has a limited range of effectiveness. It's like having a library of functions in
        python or C++!

        One thing this book does remarkably well is build the world through plot. One of my major pet-peeves with fantasy 
        novels is building the world through exposition dumps. It feels like reading a textbook, and I read books to avoid 
        scholastic activities. But <em>Foundryside</em> does an excellent job of showing the reader the world through the plot: 
        the magic is explained by exploring its impacts in the world. We learn of the ability to hack scrived objects because 
        the main character needs to break a lock. We learn about the lore through its influence on characters decisions and motivations. 

        The main character was "scrived." It reminds the reader of contemporary concerns like micro-chipping human minds. 

        The actually writing was innovative. The way characters talk with scrived devices was entertaining and engaging.
        The way some objects were loud and obnoxious while others have charisma and personality added a depth to the
        scriving mechanic that I was not expecting.

        In short: the world building was fresh and innovative. The magic was constructed in such a way to not be 
        magic in the traditional sense, but to function more in a technological way. It allows the characters to live in a world
        with rapiers, crossbows, and fortresses, but wrestle with issues that echo our very real questions regarding AI, coding, hacking, and 
        bio-tech. The characters are engaging, though a bit derivative at times.
