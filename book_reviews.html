    <h2><em>Shorefall</em> by Robert Bennett Jackson</h2>
    <h3>Category: Fantasy</h3>
    <h3>Rating:7/10</h3>
    <p>
        <em>Shorefall</em> is the sequel to Jackson's <em>Foundryside</em>. (I'm not going to dive into the world and
        its tech/magic system; please see my review of <em>Foundryside</em>.) The novel begins several years after the
        events of <em>Foundryside</em>, and we find our characters facing the consequences of their actions in
        <em>Foundryside</em>. At least that's what I was hoping to find. And I did to a small extent. But not nearly
        enough. I was expecting the same kind of focus as <em>Foundryside</em>: exploring the use of scriving, the human
        questions around the technology. That was what made <em>Foundryside</em> shine: the use of a clever fantasy-tech
        mechanic to explore modern questions of A.I., human augmentation, corporate control of said technology, and so
        on. It was impressive that Jackson was able to pull off that dynamic in a decidedly <em>fantasy</em> novel, when
        intuition says it belongs in sci-fi.
    </p>
    <p>
        But <em>Shorefall</em> wants to tell a different story. And it took me some time to realize that. I was hoping
        to dive deeper into the questions about technology; what I got was a novel about morality. Namely: what do we do
        when we have the power of gods? What is human nature? Can we alter it? If so, should we? Or do we let humanity
        follow its own course, for better or worse? At first, this change of focus did not sit well with me. These
        questions have been asked for time immemorial, and I wasn't expecting another discussion on the topic.
        <em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em> is a prime example of modern media that wrestled with this question. My
        expectations, in a sense, ruined the initial read. The novel starts off fast and does not let up. Page after
        page is filled with a sense of urgency. Normally, I like that. But it felt unearned. The dreaded antagonist
        appears quickly, whereas I was hoping for more anticipation and conflict. <em>Foundryside</em> created the sense
        that the antagonist was an unbeatable force, that everything must be done to prevent his arrival. But there is
        no struggle to prevent it: the main characters are "cheated" out of an attempt, outdone by off-page secrecy. It
        felt like a reverse ex-machina, where instead of good things happening without proper justification, bad things
        happen with cheap justification. It just happens because the plot needs it to. It felt like the warnings of the
        first novel were empty: we didn't really need to worry about it. It happened and we're all okay.
        I also was disappointed in how the scriving mechanic took a back seat. In <em>Foundryside</em>, we saw how
        characters interacted with this technology, how it could be hacked, and how it could be weak or powerful.
        Unfortunately, we get less of that. It was a strong point of the first novel. Instead, we are often just told
        that Sancia breaks through the scriving and don't get to see the logic games she plays with the objects. We do
        have a few moments, but not as many as I would have liked. We spend less time interacting and exploring the
        effects of technology, and more using the technology as a plot device. It goes from being the focus of the
        story—a specific technology and its consequences—to a tool used to explore different ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
        But I think these problems vanish if we realize what the point of the novel is. The big-bad isn't really the
        antagonist: the true enemy of the characters is, in a sense, the technology. In that light, the reverse
        ex-machina is less of a cheat: the climax in the conflict is not the arrival of the big-bad, but rather the slow
        growth and corruption of the technology, all of which is spurred along by both protagonists and antagonists
        alike. In that way, the story is more of a proto-tragedy, with catastrophe seemingly inevitable. Civilization in
        Jackson's world seems doomed to destroy itself, as it has done time and time again. Jackson asks: "Is this doom
        unavoidable? Is it true that human ingenuity, creativity, and inventiveness will always be our downfall? Are we
        the victims of our own designs?" And, to give Jackson credit, the characters do a wonderful job of giving
        different answers to this question. One character responds with: "Yes, it is inevitable. Human invention will
        always be used for violence and destruction. To avoid doing so, we must remove the impulse for violence from
        human nature. Allow innovation, but remove the destructive instinct." Another wants to go further: "Yes, but not
        only should we remove the destructive instinct, we should remove the ability for innovation. Humanity is
        happier, healthier in a state of pure nature. 'Tis better to be a noble savage than a corrupted citizen." And,
        of course, there is the negative answer: "No, humanity is not doomed to destroy itself through its technology.
        We can improve, we can do better." So yes, these are answers to an immortal question, but I think Jackson gives
        the question better justice than other authors. It's tempting to give an easy answer (looking at you
        <em>Avengers</em>), and Jackson certainly seems to have his response. It isn't a work of literature—this novel
        is still meant for entertainment. But for a fantasy novel, Jackson definitely wants to take these questions more
        seriously than a typical fantasy author might. And serious credit should be given for that effort.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once we understand what Jackson wants to do with <em>Shorefall</em>, then we can appreciate the work. But it
        definitely diverges from <em>Foundryside</em>, and that discontinuity in storytelling is jarring.
        <em>Foundryside</em> was asking far more pointed questions about computer-like technology, A.I., and human
        augmentation; <em>Shorefall</em> goes more abstract, asking questions about human nature and its potential for
        self-destruction. These questions are related, but not synonymous, and hence I think more transition was
        required for the two novels to better flow together. I am excited to see how Jackson ends the series. The ending
        of <em>Shorefall</em> sets the stakes high, and certainly takes the abstract question and makes it real. I
        totally expect Jackson to answer his question in the positive, that humanity is not doomed to destroy itself.
        What I want to see is how he delivers that answer: does he give the devil his due, or does he just "love and
        friendship" his way out of a complicated existential problem? In that respect, the legacy of <em>Shorefall</em>
        depends on the final book (of course—that's how trilogies work). But Jackson did do a good job of setting up the
        stakes in an impactful way, one where the solution is not obvious, and our characters are faced with legitimate
        challenges. That's exciting, and it is a sign of a good author. I should also mention that Jackson maintains the
        high level of characters, dialogue, and storytelling. The original cast of characters is just as engaging as it
        was in <em>Foundryside</em>, and the introduction and exploration of the big-bad was wonderful. I am a sucker
        for a great villain, and Jackson delivers a good one. He's charismatic, patient, intelligent, and has a
        compelling motivation. He doesn't make foolish mistakes, and is ruthless in his pursuits. So credit is earned
        there, and it definitely adds to the novel. In short: <em>Shorefall</em> loses some marks for abruptly changing
        meta-story course, but once the new course is set, it does an above-average job of navigating a time-honored
        problem with well-developed characters in a well-developed world.

    <h2><em>Empire of the Damend</em> by Jay Kristoff</h2>
    <h3>Category: Fantasy</h3>
    <h3>Rating: 8/10</h3>
    <p>
        This novel is the sequel to Kristoff's <em>Empire of the Vampire</em>, which was brought to life in 2021.
        To be frank: Kristoff is my favorite contemporary author. His <em>Nevernight</em> series brought me back to
        reading
        after a friend insisted I give it a try. The world of Mia Corvere trapped me in ways no other book has done. The
        plot, the character,
        the world building, the magic system, to me were all top tier, and no one has come close. But what took
        <em>Nevernight</em> to a different level
        was Kristoff himself. I found his writing bold, willing to try new things (who knew that <em>footnotes</em>
        would add so much to a fantasy tale). His banter
        is unmatched; the dialogue is rich and adds a third and fourth dimensions to characters. Kristoff also does an
        excellent job of being gritty. People die. People you care about.
        They die in unpleasant ways. And he tells you upfront that he's going to do it. Now, it's not quite as jarring
        or subsersive as say <em>Game of Thrones</em>, but all
        of these elements together make for a masterful story, and it remains my favorite this day in the fantasy
        category. If I was writing reviews back then, I would have given all three
        novels either a 10/10 or 9/10.
    </p>
    <p>
        This brings us to <em>Empire of the Vampire</em>. The first novel was also excellent. It tells the story of a
        Christian-like
        empire that wages war against vampiric forces. However, there are individuals called "silversaints." These are
        men
        whose parentage is half human and half vampire. They are recruitied by the Order of San Michon (one of the
        saints of the religion) and
        trained to fight vampires. Being half vampire, they inherit some of their powers, but also their thirst. The
        main character, Gabriel de Leon
        (Kristoff makes this world French-like; <em>Nevernight</em> was Roman) is the last such silversaint. As is
        vintage Kristoff, you know by page one
        that the vampires have won, and now the blood-sucking bastards rule over the continent. The story has two
        layers: there is Gabriel as a captive to the
        vampire Empress, kept to relay his journey and knowledge of the Holy Grail to the vampire historian,
        Jean-Francois. The second layer is the story that Gabriel tells, which
        traverses parts of his lifetime, from his youth and recruitment into the order, to his discovery of the Grail.
        The novel (a healthy 750 pages or so) ends with Gabriel on the run
        with the Grail.
    </p>
    <p>
        I throughly enjoyed <em>EoV</em>. It has many of the same qualities that <em>Nevernight</em> does, and I would
        venture to say that the world building here is
        even more expansive. It's also far darker, with the basic scenery being one of rot and filth. There's very
        little to smile at the world of de Leon. When there is, well,
        it's Kristoff, so don't get too attached. But he also gives you just enough to think there's more going on. But
        only just. The way Gabriel talks with his captors, they way he
        seems remarkably calm for someone who fought his wholes life for, what now, is nothing. When I put it down, I
        could not wait for the sequel. But wait I did (three years people, three!).
    </p>

    <p>
        I picked up <em>Empire of the Damned</em> the day it was released. I was finishing <em>Pale Blue Eye</em> at the
        time, but as soon as I did, I plunged once again into the world of de Leon. At again
        750 pages, it was a solid read. But it went by quick---at least it felt that way. It picks up right where
        <em>EoV</em> left off, and the pace does not slow down.

        I think, however, that <em>Empire of the Damned</em> is a weaker addition. There are a few reasons for this
        view. First, I felt that the plot became too narrow: for such a large world, all of the events take place in a
        single
        country against one faction of vampires, and it's not even the main big bad from the first novel. There were a
        few ex machina's---both in characters that died-but-didn't and other mechanisms---that were so obivous, I felt
        nothing when
        they were revealed. For example: two characters have similar backstories with this vampire faction, but one is
        good and the other bad. They'll probably show up at the last second in the climax and fight. And voila! There it
        is! On the flip side,
        some of the betrayals we less betrayals and the character not opening their eyes to the obvious. More than once,
        I was yelling "No shit Sherlock! Why did you not think of that?" Now, there are times when the reader knows
        something is wrong.
        Often this is intentional, and the writer completely intends for it. It's like the subtle hints and clues that I
        was referring to earlier. Your mind knows something lurks in the shadows of the plot, but you put up your guard
        as your hair stands on end.
        There are times when Kristoff pulls this effect off well. Other times, it's less shadows-in-the-dark and more
        actors-at-a-frat-haunted-house. I see you. I know you're going to pop out. Do you see my shock and surprise? No?
        Dang.

        There were also moments when the "boss" didn't live up to my expectations. In <em>EoV</em>, there is one vampire
        who pursues Gabriel and company, and it is very clear that this beast is
        not to be trifled with. Kristoff makes that clear by not just saying so, but showing the reader that this
        vampire means certain death. He is terrifying, and you genuinely worry for the characters' survival.
        That was less so the case with some of the vampires in <em>EoD</em>: a lot of talk, but the action did not
        reflect the expectations. I didn't feel same fear and suspense that I did in <em>EoV</em>. Now, there are some
        vampires, that filled me with dread. But
        that was less so for their strength---something that would heighten a fight scene---and more so for their
        ability to manipulate and twist. I will give a lot of credit: Kristoff does an excellent job showing how sexual
        forces and charismatic abilities are just
        as dangerous as skill with a sword. In some contexts, it far more lethal. That dynamic shines in <em>EoD</em>,
        whereas the warrior dynamic is more present in <em>EoV</em>.

        Now, if these novel is so terrible, why am I giving it a 8/10? The answer is two-fold.
        One: it's still a great read. Kristoff still shines, and the clues and hints in <em>EoV</em> are beginning to
        add up. (Though I worry, like I referred to, that it might be
        a hair too obvious). There are still subversions that are expertly executed; conspiracies and betrayals that add
        wonderful tension. And let's not forget that this world Kristoff has built is still hopeless. The faction of
        vampires that Gabriel wars with is unlike anything I've seen put to the page or screen when it comes to
        classical monsters. Some of the scenes still make me squirm; some of the blood-shed still makes me wince. Again:
        Kristoff is daring, not afraid
        to make blood-sucking, murdering, creatures of the never-ending night as raw and gruesome as his dark
        imagination can conceive. In a way, if the first book set the big picture for this world, the second zooms in on
        a particular set of
        vampires in a particular part of that world, and we see every rotting part of it. The banter is still solid,
        though not as original as in the first novel. A few action scenes still maintain a degree of scale and raw
        power, though I wish they were longer or there were more of them. There is a massive
        battle scene, but, as I said, it lacks the same level of tension that I've seen from Kristoff. Kristoff also is
        a master of subtly woving in quite mature themes without being obnoxious. For exmaple, I think that the romance
        in this book is wonderful. I can't say I was expecting that. But it touches on themes of loss and redemption in
        ways that I wish other
        writers would consider. Questions of faith from the first novel carry over into the second. However, in the
        first, I found the commentary to be rudimentary; the second adds a delicious new dimension the theme of faith
        and religion, though it comes towards the end.
        Two: if I appear over-critical, it's simply because my expectations for Kristoff are so high. This is the man
        that made me fall desperately in love with reading. Kristoff set my standard for modern fantasy and fiction---
        if it's too high, then it's his own damn fault. Perhaps most importantly, Kristoff is setting up for an
        excellent third book (but please please please don't make me wait another three years for it. No I am not
        patient, so stop asking me to be). The two layers I referred to are
        both heading in an exciting directions. Those small hints and clues from the first book are already starting to
        pay off, and a careful, thoughtful reader will already have a ideas of what's at play, especially in the first
        layer. There are still
        critical questions that are left unanswered. Actually, one of my worries is that Kristoff has set up
        <em>too</em> much, and one book won't be enough to satisfactorily finish each of the plot lines (I don't want a
        second <em>Kingdom of Ash</em>; ask me about <em>that</em> if you want to know how to
        imporerly end an epic saga). But, if <em>Nevernight</em> is any reliable guide, then Kristoff will pull it all
        off in ways only he can, and I will somehow read 500+ pages in a day because I simply can't put it down.
        All in all, I think <em>Empire of the Damned</em> has some uncharacteristic weaknesses. But they are
        uncharacteristic because Kristoff is such a strong fantasy writer. To be fair, the second entry in the
        <em>Nevernight</em> triology was also the weakest in my mind (this is a hotly contested point amongst myself and
        my reading friends). So perhaps there's just something
        with me and Kristoff-second-entries. But the story still brings the reader to a bleak, helpless world where we
        are the blood-filled meat sacks. There is no respect for humanity. Vampires don't hide in the shadows: they tear
        down castle walls and hang their victims from the ceilings in celebration. Nowhere feels safe. Mercy is as rare
        as the sun. The reader still feels like every
        scrap of hope is vaporized before it can reach our fingertips. Kristoff still makes this world our reality.
        There are just a few moments when we can relax because we know what's coming.

    <h2><em>The Pale Blue Eye</em> by Louis Bayard</h2>
    <h3>Category: Mystery/Thriller</h3>
    <h3>Rating: 8/10</h3>
    <p>
        I know very little about Edgar Allan Poe, and to be frank, I think that made reading this book all the much
        better. It kept the characters and plot fresh--I had no clues to direct my literary investigations. But this
        book
        was excellent. Now, to be honest, writing this review is difficult, because the novel does such a wonderful job
        of hiding <em>itself</em> from the reader that I find myself biting my tongue out of fear of giving it all away.
        The last seventy-five or so pages is a tour-de-force in thriller writing. There is enough in the preceeding
        pages to make the
        ending <em>possible</em> but not so much as it make it <em>necessary</em> and therefore predictable.
    </p>
    <p>
        One thing to be aware of: this novel is not, stricly speaking, a murder mystery. It does not follow the
        Holmes/Poirot style of
        mystery, investigation, and brilliant reveal where all the pieces fall into perfect place and we the reader feel
        a tinge dumber for
        not realizing it ourselves. But it doesn't need to; this story is not about putting the pieces together. It is
        not about catching all the subtle
        clues. I could feel myself falling into that trap. I was beginning to worry that this was going to end up like
        so many mystery novels do: the investigator
        "solves" the mystery not through wit or keen investigation skills, but because the mystery solves itself through
        lucky encounters, last minute epiphanies, and
        seeing the bad guy at the right time. (Personally this is a cardinal sin in murder-mystery writing.) But at the
        end, when I put the book down, a grin crawled upon my face
        because it had tricked me. I thought it was going to commit this terrible literary sin, but it was I who
        committed the sin of being too proud to see what was going on
        the whole time. The pieces that came together weren't clues found at a crime scene; they were the literary
        devices and tools used by Mr. Bayard to masterful effect.
        For that display alone, this book deserves applause.
    </p>
    <p>
        On more techincal aspects, Bayard does well. His use of language does transfix the reader in early ninetheenth
        century New York. The customs of early America can be seen, and the dialogue
        is exactly what I would expect to hear from early Americans. Something that stands out is how characters are
        distinguished by their words. Poe the character reflects Poe the poet that we all know.
        His words are carefully chosen to be colorful, filled with theatrics. One readily believes that this could have
        been a young Poe. The way the protangonist is curt demonstrates his simple but brutal
        detective's mind. There are times when I think Bayard tries a bit too hard to be a poet. Some of the
        descriptions I found to be more nonsense than creative: my mind couldn't put together the imagery
        being lost in the verse. But these instances are few and may be readily forgiven. I would also be remiss if I
        failed to mention the sheer horrific descriptions of the crimes at play. The echoes of Poe's horror
        resonate well in these pages. On the whole, the linguistic talents of Mr. Bayard bring the characters, setting,
        and plot to life in vivid detail, though sometimes
        the details love themselves a bit too much. And yet, perhaps that's just my un-poetical mind not being able to
        see the colors in the landscape.
    </p>
    <p><em>The Pale Blue Eye</em> is a must-read for anyone looking for a mind-bending, fresh take on the murder-mystery
        novel. Yes, the book involves a young Edgar Allan Poe, but its goals are far loftier than merely
        bringing to life the esteemed poet. It isn't what you think. And it isn't what you think next either. The ending
        will stay with me for a long time, and in a way, it was something I was starving for from this genre.
        It's a shame I can't tell you what that hunger was, because it would spoil the feast Mr. Bayard has prepared for
        us.
    </p>


    <h2><em>Foundryside</em> by Robert Jackson Bennett</h2>
    <h3>Category: Fantasy</h3>
    <h3>Rating: 7/10</h3>
    <p>
        I came back to fantasy after a year-long or so dive into murder-mysteries and thrillers.
        <em>Foundryside</em> caught my eye because it seemed to be below the radar but still drew attention.
        That's a green flag to me: enough substance to garner praise but not too routine so that everyone seems to
        enjoy it. (I'm looking at you ACOTAR.) What sealed my purchase was its seemingly new magic system.
        So I picked up <em>Foundryside</em> (for a decent price, I might add).
    </p>
    <p>
        Now at the end, I can say that <em>Foundryside</em> is a strong addition to anyone's fantasy collection. It
        isn't
        groundbreaking, but it does stand out from its contemporary peers in one important aspect: the magic system.
        As someone who deals with computer science and programming, I was captured by the magic system's resemblance
        to computer coding and the culture around it. Anyone in computer science should read this book; anyone who
        thinks computer science poses deep questions should read this book. I fully intend to finish this series solely
        because I want to know more about the magic of <em>Foundryside</em> called <em>scriving</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Calling it "magic" is a bit of a misnomer. The book isn't fantasy in a Harry Potter or LOTR sense. A better
        description would be magic-based sci-fi. The premise is the following: objects can be altered by writing sigils
        on them.
        These sigils "persuade" the object. For example, someone could take a lumber beam, scrive it with sigils that
        tell it
        it's made of iron, and then the beam now believes—and thus behaves as if—it was made of iron. This process is
        called <em>scriving</em>;
        people who practice scriving are called scrivers. So while the foundations are magical—we don't know why
        scriving works and
        it's akin to writing spells—the functionality of the novel is sci-fi.
        Scrivers combine sigils to create new sigils: they define a new sigil. But they have to collect these
        definitions
        in an object called a <em>lexicon</em> in order to use it. It's like defining a dictionary or class in Python or
        C++. These sigils can be
        <em>hacked</em>: certain characters
        can "talk" to scrived objects, listen to the logic of their sigils, then twist the meaning to make the scrived
        objects do something they weren't meant to.

        So the idea is fresh and original, but the novel takes this framework and incorporates contemporary concerns
        regarding
        technology. We worry about bio-tech and how we might modify our bodies with computers; characters in the novel
        have been scrived
        and have "powers" because of it. All the rage in the scientific community is AI and machine learning; some
        objects have such complicated
        scriving that they begin to have their own personality (some have a complete personality, but why is part of the
        story).

        The world is rich and has subtle references to modern trends and problems. But that means there's potential, not
        that as a story, it works well.
        But even here Patterson is solid. He expertly avoids the kiss of death for fantasy novels: build the world via
        gobs and gobs of exposition. It kills the
        narration, bringing the plot to a screeching halt so we can and read a textbook. Patterson does not do this. He
        builds the world through the plot. We learn
        about the rules and loopholes of scriving because the characters must grapple with them and their consequences.
        We learn that scrives can be "hacked" because a character
        needs to break into a camp. We learn about these lexicons—the sigil dictionaries—and their drawbacks because
        they need to use one in the climax. The actual writing was engaging.
        The way characters talk with scrived devices was entertaining.
        The way some objects were loud and obnoxious while others have charisma and personality added a depth to the
        scriving mechanic that I was not expecting. The ability of Patterson to explore scientific ideas with narrative
        that was both technical and entertaining makes this novel pop. It's not the
        first book I've read that does world-building well, but it is the first I've encountered that uses magic to
        build up a technological world. For that, it deserves credit.

    <p>Now, it's not perfect. Sometimes the vocabulary was mediocre. I am a sucker for deep, rich descriptions of the
        world. I want the author to paint me a picture and use a massive palette to do so.
        This was the palette of an undergraduate or an early graduate student. It doesn't lose points for the
        vocabulary, but it doesn't gain any either. Some of the characters seem
        to be conforming to modern clichés, i.e., the main character is a young woman with a troubled past who has a
        unique set of skills (in this case, she's a thief). They don't detract from the story
        but that's because the story is more about the scriving than it is about any one particular character. It just
        seems like these clichés are slid into the plot because... well, there is no because, and
        that's the problem. But, like I said, it doesn't detract, only distract for a moment or two.

    <p><em>Foundryside</em> is a magic-based sci-fi novel that promises readers a well-built world that is explored
        through effective storytelling. At roughly three-hundred pages, it's a pleasant read that
        doesn't waste time getting to the point. It manages to emulate real technological problems while still helping
        us escape to a different reality. The characters can be a bit derivative but
        serve their purpose while being colorful but not loud. The plot is grand without being obnoxious. The
        magic-but-technology system is what brings this novel to life, and it deserves a spot on any lover of
        science fiction or fantasy's bookshelf.
