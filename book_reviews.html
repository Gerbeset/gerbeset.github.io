    <h2><em>The Pale Blue Eye</em> by Louis Bayard</h2>
    <h3>Category: Mystery/Thriller</h3>
    <h3>Rating: 8/10</h3>
    <p>
        I know very little about Edgar Allan Poe, and to be frank, I think that made reading this book all the much
        better. It kept the characters and plot fresh--I had no clues to direct my literary investigations. But this book 
        was excellent. Now, to be honest, writing this review is difficult, because the novel does such a wonderful job 
        of hiding <em>itself</em> from the reader that I find myself biting my tongue out of fear of giving it all away. 
        The last seventy-five or so pages is a tour-de-force in thriller writing. There is enough in the preceeding pages to make the 
        ending <em>possible</em> but not so much as it make it <em>necessary</em> and therefore predictable.
    </p>
    <p>
        One thing to be aware of: this novel is not, stricly speaking, a murder mystery. It does not follow the Holmes/Poirot style of 
        mystery, investigation, and brilliant reveal where all the pieces fall into perfect place and we the reader feel a tinge dumber for 
        not realizing it ourselves. But it doesn't need to; this story is not about putting the pieces together. It is not about catching all the subtle 
        clues. I could feel myself falling into that trap. I was beginning to worry that this was going to end up like so many mystery novels do: the investigator 
        "solves" the mystery not through wit or keen investigation skills, but because the mystery solves itself through lucky encounters, last minute epiphanies, and 
        seeing the bad guy at the right time. (Personally this is a cardinal sin in murder-mystery writing.) But at the end, when I put the book down, a grin crawled upon my face
        because it had tricked me. I thought it was going to commit this terrible literary sin, but it was I who committed the sin of being too proud to see what was going on 
        the whole time. The pieces that came together weren't clues found at a crime scene; they were the literary devices and tools used by Mr. Bayard to masterful effect. 
        For that display alone, this book deserves applause. 
    </p>
    <p>
        On more techincal aspects, Bayard does well. His use of language does transfix the reader in early ninetheenth century New York. The customs of early America can be seen, and the dialogue 
        is exactly what I would expect to hear from early Americans. Something that stands out is how characters are distinguished by their words. Poe the character reflects Poe the poet that we all know. 
        His words are carefully chosen to be colorful, filled with theatrics. One readily believes that this could have been a young Poe. The way the protangonist is curt demonstrates his simple but brutal 
        detective's mind. There are times when I think Bayard tries a bit too hard to be a poet. Some of the descriptions I found to be more nonsense than creative: my mind couldn't put together the imagery 
        being lost in the verse. But these instances are few and may be readily forgiven. I would also be remiss if I failed to mention the sheer horrific descriptions of the crimes at play. The echoes of Poe's horror 
        resonate well in these pages. On the whole, the linguistic talents of Mr. Bayard bring the characters, setting, and plot to life in vivid detail, though sometimes 
        the details love themselves a bit too much. And yet, perhaps that's just my un-poetical mind not being able to see the colors in the landscape. 
    </p>
    <p><em>The Pale Blue Eye</em> is a must-read for anyone looking for a mind-bending, fresh take on the murder-mystery novel. Yes, the book involves a young Edgar Allan Poe, but its goals are far loftier than merely 
        bringing to life the esteemed poet. It isn't what you think. And it isn't what you think next either. The ending will stay with me for a long time, and in a way, it was something I was starving for from this genre. 
        It's a shame I can't tell you what that hunger was, because it would spoil the feast Mr. Bayard has prepared for us.

    <h2><em>Foundryside</em> by Robert Jackson Bennett</h2>
    <h3>Category: Fantasy</h3>
    <h3>Rating: 7/10</h3>
    <p>
        I came back to fantasy after a year-long or so dive into murder-mysteries and thrillers.
        <em>Foundryside</em> caught my eye because it seemed to be below the radar but still drew attention.
        That's a green flag to me: enough substance to garner praise but not too routine so that everyone seems to
        enjoy it. (I'm looking at you ACOTAR.) What sealed my purchase was its seemingly new magic system.
        So I picked up <em>Foundryside</em> (for a decent price, I might add).
    </p>
    <p>
        Now at the end, I can say that <em>Foundryside</em> is a strong addition to anyone's fantasy collection. It
        isn't
        groundbreaking, but it does stand out from its contemporary peers in one important aspect: the magic system.
        As someone who deals with computer science and programming, I was captured by the magic system's resemblance
        to computer coding and the culture around it. Anyone in computer science should read this book; anyone who
        thinks computer science poses deep questions should read this book. I fully intend to finish this series solely
        because I want to know more about the magic of <em>Foundryside</em> called <em>scriving</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Calling it "magic" is a bit of a misnomer. The book isn't fantasy in a Harry Potter or LOTR sense. A better
        description would be magic-based sci-fi. The premise is the following: objects can be altered by writing sigils
        on them.
        These sigils "persuade" the object. For example, someone could take a lumber beam, scrive it with sigils that
        tell it
        it's made of iron, and then the beam now believes—and thus behaves as if—it was made of iron. This process is
        called <em>scriving</em>;
        people who practice scriving are called scrivers. So while the foundations are magical—we don't know why
        scriving works and
        it's akin to writing spells—the functionality of the novel is sci-fi.
        Scrivers combine sigils to create new sigils: they define a new sigil. But they have to collect these
        definitions
        in an object called a <em>lexicon</em> in order to use it. It's like defining a dictionary or class in Python or
        C++. These sigils can be
        <em>hacked</em>: certain characters
        can "talk" to scrived objects, listen to the logic of their sigils, then twist the meaning to make the scrived
        objects do something they weren't meant to.
    </p>
    <p>
        So the idea is fresh and original, but the novel takes this framework and incorporates contemporary concerns
        regarding
        technology. We worry about bio-tech and how we might modify our bodies with computers; characters in the novel
        have been scrived
        and have "powers" because of it. All the rage in the scientific community is AI and machine learning; some
        objects have such complicated
        scriving that they begin to have their own personality (some have a complete personality, but why is part of the
        story).
    </p>
    <p>
        The world is rich and has subtle references to modern trends and problems. But that means there's potential, not
        that as a story, it works well.
        But even here Patterson is solid. He expertly avoids the kiss of death for fantasy novels: build the world via
        gobs and gobs of exposition. It kills the
        narration, bringing the plot to a screeching halt so we can and read a textbook. Patterson does not do this. He
        builds the world through the plot. We learn
        about the rules and loopholes of scriving because the characters must grapple with them and their consequences.
        We learn that scrives can be "hacked" because a character
        needs to break into a camp. We learn about these lexicons—the sigil dictionaries—and their drawbacks because
        they need to use one in the climax. The actual writing was engaging.
        The way characters talk with scrived devices was entertaining.
        The way some objects were loud and obnoxious while others have charisma and personality added a depth to the
        scriving mechanic that I was not expecting. The ability of Patterson to explore scientific ideas with narrative
        that was both technical and entertaining makes this novel pop. It's not the
        first book I've read that does world-building well, but it is the first I've encountered that uses magic to
        build up a technological world. For that, it deserves credit.
    </p>
    <p>Now, it's not perfect. Sometimes the vocabulary was mediocre. I am a sucker for deep, rich descriptions of the
        world. I want the author to paint me a picture and use a massive palette to do so.
        This was the palette of an undergraduate or an early graduate student. It doesn't lose points for the
        vocabulary, but it doesn't gain any either. Some of the characters seem
        to be conforming to modern clichés, i.e., the main character is a young woman with a troubled past who has a
        unique set of skills (in this case, she's a thief). They don't detract from the story
        but that's because the story is more about the scriving than it is about any one particular character. It just
        seems like these clichés are slid into the plot because... well, there is no because, and
        that's the problem. But, like I said, it doesn't detract, only distract for a moment or two.
    </p>
    <p><em>Foundryside</em> is a magic-based sci-fi novel that promises readers a well-built world that is explored
        through effective storytelling. At roughly three-hundred pages, it's a pleasant read that
        doesn't waste time getting to the point. It manages to emulate real technological problems while still helping
        us escape to a different reality. The characters can be a bit derivative but
        serve their purpose while being colorful but not loud. The plot is grand without being obnoxious. The
        magic-but-technology system is what brings this novel to life, and it deserves a spot on any lover of
        science fiction or fantasy's bookshelf.
