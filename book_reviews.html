    <h2><em>Foundryside</em> by Robert Jackson Bennett</h2>
    <h3>Category: Fantasy</h3>
    <h3>Rating: 8.5/10</h3>
    <p>
        I came back to fantasy after a year-long or so dive into murder-mysteries and thrillers.
        <em>Foundryside</em> caught my eye because it seemed to be below the radar but still drew attention.
        That's a green flag to me: enough substance to garner praise but not too routine so that everyone seems to
        enjoy it. (I'm looking at you ACOTAR.) What sealed my purchase was its seemingly new magic system.
        So I picked up <em>Foundryside</em> (for a decent price, I might add).
    </p>
    <p>
        Now at the end, I can say that <em>Foundryside</em> is a strong addition to anyone's fantasy collection. It isn't
        groundbreaking, but it does stand out from its contemporary peers in one important aspect: the magic system.
        As someone who deals with computer science and programming, I was captured by the magic system's resemblance
        to computer coding and the culture around it. Anyone in computer science should read this book; anyone who
        thinks computer science poses deep questions should read this book. I fully intend to finish this series solely
        because I want to know more about the magic of <em>Foundryside</em> called <em>scriving</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Calling it "magic" is a bit of a misnomer. The book isn't fantasy in a Harry Potter or LOTR sense. A better
        description would be magic-based sci-fi. The premise is the following: objects can be altered by writing sigils
        on them.
        These sigils "persuade" the object. For example, someone could take a lumber beam, scrive it with sigils that
        tell it
        it's made of iron, and then the beam now believes—and thus behaves as if—it was made of iron. This process is
        called <em>scriving</em>;
        people who practice scriving are called scrivers. So while the foundations are magical—we don't know why
        scriving works and
        it's akin to writing spells—the functionality of the novel is sci-fi.
        Scrivers combine sigils to create new sigils: they define a new sigil. But they have to collect these definitions
        in an object in order to use it. It's like defining a dictionary or class in Python or C++. These sigils can be
        <em>hacked</em>: certain characters
        can "talk" to scrived objects, listen to the logic of their sigils, then twist the meaning to make the scrived
        objects do something they weren't meant to.
    </p>
    <p>
        So the idea is fresh and original, but the novel takes this framework and incorporates contemporary concerns regarding
        technology. We worry about bio-tech and how we might modify our bodies with computers; characters in the novel have been scrived
        and have "powers" because of it. All the rage in the scientific community is AI and machine learning; some objects have such complicated
        scriving that they begin to have their own personality (some have a complete personality, but why is part of the story).
    </p>
    <p>
        The world is rich and has subtle references to modern trends and problems. But that means there's potential, not that as a story, it works well.
        But even here Patterson is solid. He expertly avoids the kiss of death for fantasy novels: build the world via gobs and gobs of exposition. It kills the
        narration, bringing the plot to a screeching halt so we can and read a textbook. Patterson does not do this. He builds the world through the plot. We learn
        about the rules and loopholes of scriving because the characters must grapple with them and their consequences. We learn that scrives can be "hacked" because a character
        needs to break into a camp. We learn about these lexicons—the sigil dictionaries—and their drawbacks because they need to use one in the climax.  The actual writing was engaging.
        The way characters talk with scrived devices was entertaining.
        The way some objects were loud and obnoxious while others have charisma and personality added a depth to the
        scriving mechanic that I was not expecting. The ability of Patterson to explore scientific ideas with narrative that was both technical and entertaining makes this novel pop. It's not the
        first book I've read that does world-building well, but it is the first I've encountered that uses magic to build up a technological world. For that, it deserves credit.
    </p>
    <p>Now, it's not perfect. Sometimes the vocabulary was mediocre. I am a sucker for deep, rich descriptions of the world. I want the author to paint me a picture and use a massive palette to do so.
        This was the palette of an undergraduate or an early graduate student. It doesn't lose points for the vocabulary, but it doesn't gain any either. Some of the characters seem
        to be conforming to modern clichés, i.e., the main character is a young woman with a troubled past who has a unique set of skills (in this case, she's a thief). They don't detract from the story
        but that's because the story is more about the scriving than it is about any one particular character. It just seems like these clichés are slid into the plot because... well, there is no because, and
        that's the problem. But, like I said, it doesn't detract, only distract for a moment or two.
    </p>
    <p><em>Foundryside</em> is a magic-based sci-fi novel that promises readers a well-built world that is explored through effective storytelling. At roughly three-hundred pages, it's a pleasant read that
        doesn't waste time getting to the point. It manages to emulate real technological problems while still helping us escape to a different reality. The characters can be a bit derivative but
        serve their purpose while being colorful but not loud. The plot is grand without being obnoxious. The magic-but-technology system is what brings this novel to life, and it deserves a spot on any lover of
        science fiction or fantasy's bookshelf.
