    <h2><em>Empire of the Damend</em> by Jay Kristoff</h2>
    <h3>Category: Fantasy</h3>
    <h3>Rating: 8/10</h3>
    <p>
        This novel is the sequel to Kristoff's <em>Empire of the Vampire</em>, which was brought to life in 2021.
        To be frank: Kristoff is my favorite contemporary author. His <em>Nevernight</em> series brought me back to
        reading
        after a friend insisted I give it a try. The world of Mia Corvere trapped me in ways no other book has done. The
        plot, the character,
        the world building, the magic system, to me were all top tier, and no one has come close. But what took
        <em>Nevernight</em> to a different level
        was Kristoff himself. I found his writing bold, willing to try new things (who knew that <em>footnotes</em>
        would add so much to a fantasy tale). His banter
        is unmatched; the dialogue is rich and adds a third and fourth dimensions to characters. Kristoff also does an
        excellent job of being gritty. People die. People you care about.
        They die in unpleasant ways. And he tells you upfront that he's going to do it. Now, it's not quite as jarring
        or subsersive as say <em>Game of Thrones</em>, but all
        of these elements together make for a masterful story, and it remains my favorite this day in the fantasy
        category. If I was writing reviews back then, I would have given all three
        novels either a 10/10 or 9/10.
    </p>
    <p>
        This brings us to <em>Empire of the Vampire</em>. The first novel was also excellent. It tells the story of a Christian-like
        empire that wages war against vampiric forces. However, there are individuals called "silversaints." These are men 
        whose parentage is half human and half vampire. They are recruitied by the Order of San Michon (one of the saints of the religion) and 
        trained to fight vampires. Being half vampire, they inherit some of their powers, but also their thirst. The main character, Gabriel de Leon 
        (Kristoff makes this world French-like; <em>Nevernight</em> was Roman) is the last such silversaint. As is vintage Kristoff, you know by page one 
        that the vampires have won, and now the blood-sucking bastards rule over the continent. The story has two layers: there is Gabriel as a captive to the 
        vampire Empress, kept to relay his journey and knowledge of the Holy Grail to the vampire historian, Jean-Francois. The second layer is the story that Gabriel tells, which 
        traverses parts of his lifetime, from his youth and recruitment into the order, to his discovery of the Grail. The novel (a healthy 750 pages or so) ends with Gabriel on the run 
        with the Grail.
    </p>
    <p>
        I throughly enjoyed <em>EoV</em>. It has many of the same qualities that <em>Nevernight</em> does, and I would venture to say that the world building here is 
        even more expansive. It's also far darker, with the basic scenery being one of rot and filth. There's very little to smile at the world of de Leon. When there is, well, 
        it's Kristoff, so don't get too attached. But he also gives you just enough to think there's more going on. But only just. The way Gabriel talks with his captors, they way he 
        seems remarkably calm for someone who fought his wholes life for, what now, is nothing. When I put it down, I could not wait for the sequel. But wait I did (three years people, three!). 
    </p>

    <p>
        I picked up <em>Empire of the Damned</em> the day it was released. I was finishing <em>Pale Blue Eye</em> at the time, but as soon as I did, I plunged once again into the world of de Leon. At again 
        750 pages, it was a solid read. But it went by quick---at least it felt that way. It picks up right where <em>EoV</em> left off, and the pace does not slow down. 

        I think, however, that <em>Empire of the Damned</em> is a weaker addition. There are a few reasons for this view. First, I felt that the plot became too narrow: for such a large world, all of the events take place in a single 
        country against one faction of vampires, and it's not even the main big bad from the first novel. There were a few ex machina's---both in characters that died-but-didn't and other mechanisms---that were so obivous, I felt nothing when
        they were revealed. For example: two characters have similar backstories with this vampire faction, but one is good and the other bad. They'll probably show up at the last second in the climax and fight. And voila! There it is! On the flip side, 
        some of the betrayals we less betrayals and the character not opening their eyes to the obvious. More than once, I was yelling "No shit Sherlock! Why did you not think of that?" Now, there are times when the reader knows something is wrong. 
        Often this is intentional, and the writer completely intends for it. It's like the subtle hints and clues that I was referring to earlier. Your mind knows something lurks in the shadows of the plot, but you put up your guard as your hair stands on end. 
        There are times when Kristoff pulls this effect off well. Other times, it's less shadows-in-the-dark and more actors-at-a-frat-haunted-house. I see you. I know you're going to pop out. Do you see my shock and surprise? No? Dang. 

        There were also moments when the "boss" didn't live up to my expectations. In <em>EoV</em>, there is one vampire who pursues Gabriel and company, and it is very clear that this beast is 
        not to be trifled with. Kristoff makes that clear by not just saying so, but showing the reader that this vampire means certain death. He is terrifying, and you genuinely worry for the characters' survival. 
        That was less so the case with some of the vampires in <em>EoD</em>: a lot of talk, but the action did not reflect the expectations. I didn't feel same fear and suspense that I did in <em>EoV</em>. Now, there are some vampires, that filled me with dread. But 
        that was less so for their strength---something that would heighten a fight scene---and more so for their ability to manipulate and twist. I will give a lot of credit: Kristoff does an excellent job showing how sexual forces and charismatic abilities are just 
        as dangerous as skill with a sword. In some contexts, it far more lethal. That dynamic shines in <em>EoD</em>, whereas the warrior dynamic is more present in <em>EoV</em>. 
        
        Now, if these novel is so terrible, why am I giving it a 8/10? The answer is two-fold.
        One: it's still a great read. Kristoff still shines, and the clues and hints in <em>EoV</em> are beginning to add up. (Though I worry, like I referred to, that it might be 
        a hair too obvious). There are still subversions that are expertly executed; conspiracies and betrayals that add wonderful tension. And let's not forget that this world Kristoff has built is still hopeless. The faction of 
        vampires that Gabriel wars with is unlike anything I've seen put to the page or screen when it comes to classical monsters. Some of the scenes still make me squirm; some of the blood-shed still makes me wince. Again: Kristoff is daring, not afraid 
        to make blood-sucking, murdering, creatures of the never-ending night as raw and gruesome as his dark imagination can conceive. In a way, if the first book set the big picture for this world, the second zooms in on a particular set of 
        vampires in a particular part of that world, and we see every rotting part of it. The banter is still solid, though not as original as in the first novel. A few action scenes still maintain a degree of scale and raw power, though I wish they were longer or there were more of them. There is a massive
        battle scene, but, as I said, it lacks the same level of tension that I've seen from Kristoff. Kristoff also is a master of subtly woving in quite mature themes without being obnoxious. For exmaple, I think that the romance in this book is wonderful. I can't say I was expecting that. But it touches on themes of loss and redemption in ways that I wish other 
        writers would consider. Questions of faith from the first novel carry over into the second. However, in the first, I found the commentary to be rudimentary; the second adds a delicious new dimension the theme of faith and religion, though it comes towards the end. 
        Two: if I appear over-critical, it's simply because my expectations for Kristoff are so high. This is the man that made me fall desperately in love with reading. Kristoff set my standard for modern fantasy and fiction---
        if it's too high, then it's his own damn fault. Perhaps most importantly, Kristoff is setting up for an excellent third book (but please please please don't make me wait another three years for it. No I am not patient, so stop asking me to be). The two layers I referred to are 
        both heading in an exciting directions. Those small hints and clues from the first book are already starting to pay off, and a careful, thoughtful reader will already have a ideas of what's at play, especially in the first layer. There are still
        critical questions that are left unanswered. Actually, one of my worries is that Kristoff has set up <em>too</em> much, and one book won't be enough to satisfactorily finish each of the plot lines (I don't want a second <em>Kingdom of Ash</em>; ask me about <em>that</em> if you want to know how to 
        imporerly end an epic saga). But, if <em>Nevernight</em> is any reliable guide, then Kristoff will pull it all off in ways only he can, and I will somehow read 500+ pages in a day because I simply can't put it down. 
        All in all, I think <em>Empire of the Damned</em> has some uncharacteristic weaknesses. But they are uncharacteristic because Kristoff is such a strong fantasy writer. To be fair, the second entry in the <em>Nevernight</em> triology was also the weakest in my mind (this is a hotly contested point amongst myself and my reading friends). So perhaps there's just something 
        with me and Kristoff-second-entries. But the story still brings the reader to a bleak, helpless world where we are the blood-filled meat sacks. There is no respect for humanity. Vampires don't hide in the shadows: they tear down castle walls and hang their victims from the ceilings in celebration. Nowhere feels safe. Mercy is as rare as the sun. The reader still feels like every 
        scrap of hope is vaporized before it can reach our fingertips. Kristoff still makes this world our reality. There are just a few moments when we can relax because we know what's coming.

    <h2><em>Foundryside</em> by Robert Jackson Bennett</h2>
    <h3>Category: Fantasy</h3>
    <h3>Rating: 8.5/10</h3>
    <p>
        I came back to fantasy after a year-long or so dive into murder-mysteries and thrillers.
        <em>Foundryside</em> caught my eye because it seemed to be below the radar but still drew attention.
        That's a green flag to me: enough substance to garner praise but not too routine so that everyone seems to
        enjoy it. (I'm looking at you ACOTAR.) What sealed my purchase was its seemingly new magic system.
        So I picked up <em>Foundryside</em> (for a decent price, I might add).
    </p>
    <p>
        Now at the end, I can say that <em>Foundryside</em> is a strong addition to anyone's fantasy collection. It
        isn't
        groundbreaking, but it does stand out from its contemporary peers in one important aspect: the magic system.
        As someone who deals with computer science and programming, I was captured by the magic system's resemblance
        to computer coding and the culture around it. Anyone in computer science should read this book; anyone who
        thinks computer science poses deep questions should read this book. I fully intend to finish this series solely
        because I want to know more about the magic of <em>Foundryside</em> called <em>scriving</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Calling it "magic" is a bit of a misnomer. The book isn't fantasy in a Harry Potter or LOTR sense. A better
        description would be magic-based sci-fi. The premise is the following: objects can be altered by writing sigils
        on them.
        These sigils "persuade" the object. For example, someone could take a lumber beam, scrive it with sigils that
        tell it
        it's made of iron, and then the beam now believes—and thus behaves as if—it was made of iron. This process is
        called <em>scriving</em>;
        people who practice scriving are called scrivers. So while the foundations are magical—we don't know why
        scriving works and
        it's akin to writing spells—the functionality of the novel is sci-fi.
        Scrivers combine sigils to create new sigils: they define a new sigil. But they have to collect these
        definitions
        in an object called a <em>lexicon</em> in order to use it. It's like defining a dictionary or class in Python or
        C++. These sigils can be
        <em>hacked</em>: certain characters
        can "talk" to scrived objects, listen to the logic of their sigils, then twist the meaning to make the scrived
        objects do something they weren't meant to.
    </p>
    <p>
        So the idea is fresh and original, but the novel takes this framework and incorporates contemporary concerns
        regarding
        technology. We worry about bio-tech and how we might modify our bodies with computers; characters in the novel
        have been scrived
        and have "powers" because of it. All the rage in the scientific community is AI and machine learning; some
        objects have such complicated
        scriving that they begin to have their own personality (some have a complete personality, but why is part of the
        story).
    </p>
    <p>
        The world is rich and has subtle references to modern trends and problems. But that means there's potential, not
        that as a story, it works well.
        But even here Patterson is solid. He expertly avoids the kiss of death for fantasy novels: build the world via
        gobs and gobs of exposition. It kills the
        narration, bringing the plot to a screeching halt so we can and read a textbook. Patterson does not do this. He
        builds the world through the plot. We learn
        about the rules and loopholes of scriving because the characters must grapple with them and their consequences.
        We learn that scrives can be "hacked" because a character
        needs to break into a camp. We learn about these lexicons—the sigil dictionaries—and their drawbacks because
        they need to use one in the climax. The actual writing was engaging.
        The way characters talk with scrived devices was entertaining.
        The way some objects were loud and obnoxious while others have charisma and personality added a depth to the
        scriving mechanic that I was not expecting. The ability of Patterson to explore scientific ideas with narrative
        that was both technical and entertaining makes this novel pop. It's not the
        first book I've read that does world-building well, but it is the first I've encountered that uses magic to
        build up a technological world. For that, it deserves credit.
    </p>
    <p>Now, it's not perfect. Sometimes the vocabulary was mediocre. I am a sucker for deep, rich descriptions of the
        world. I want the author to paint me a picture and use a massive palette to do so.
        This was the palette of an undergraduate or an early graduate student. It doesn't lose points for the
        vocabulary, but it doesn't gain any either. Some of the characters seem
        to be conforming to modern clichés, i.e., the main character is a young woman with a troubled past who has a
        unique set of skills (in this case, she's a thief). They don't detract from the story
        but that's because the story is more about the scriving than it is about any one particular character. It just
        seems like these clichés are slid into the plot because... well, there is no because, and
        that's the problem. But, like I said, it doesn't detract, only distract for a moment or two.
    </p>
    <p><em>Foundryside</em> is a magic-based sci-fi novel that promises readers a well-built world that is explored
        through effective storytelling. At roughly three-hundred pages, it's a pleasant read that
        doesn't waste time getting to the point. It manages to emulate real technological problems while still helping
        us escape to a different reality. The characters can be a bit derivative but
        serve their purpose while being colorful but not loud. The plot is grand without being obnoxious. The
        magic-but-technology system is what brings this novel to life, and it deserves a spot on any lover of
        science fiction or fantasy's bookshelf.
